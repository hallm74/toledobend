    "report": "FAIR. 53 degrees; 4.33 feet below pool. Toledo Bend is fishing well, with water temperatures in the mid to upper 50s and bass being caught in a wide range of depths from 2 to 25 feet, giving anglers success with a variety of techniques across the lake. Crappie are beginning to bite well in the backs of creeks, showing up in 2-8 feet of water on live bait and jigs. However, heavy  rain is forecast this weekend, which could muddy up the creeks and slow the bite; it may take several days to a week for conditions to stabilize afterward. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

    "report": "FAIR. 90 degrees; 3.44 feet below pool. Water temperatures are finally starting to fall, beginning around 80 degrees in the mornings and climbing to 84-86 degrees during the day, and bass fishing is picking up nicely from shallow to deep water. The shallow water bite, 3-7 feet, has been good around grass and flooded timber on topwater and buzzbaits, while the mid-range, 10-18 feet, has produced on shallow-running crankbaits and Texas rigs. Out deeper in 18-24 feet, big crankbaits, Texas rigs, and Carolina rigs with big worms have been the go-to. No crappie reports have come in this week. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Mar 5, 2025",
    "report": "SLOW. Water stained; 58 degrees; 0.79 feet below pool. Water temperatures are staying in mid to high 50s. Bass are fair in 1-5 feet of water with wacky worms, senkos and Texas rigged lizards. On windy days spinnerbaits and chatterbaits are best. Some bass can be caught on main and secondary points with shallow crankbaits and Carolina rigs. Deeper fish have been hard to find this past week due to high winds, but there are still some in 15-20 feet. Crappie improved to good until this last blast of cold air slowed the bite. Expect the bite to pick back up at the end of next week. Best depths will be in 4-8 feet in backs of creeks with clear water with roadrunners and tube jigs. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

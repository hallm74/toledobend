    "report": "GOOD. Water stained; 90 degrees; 0.98 feet below pool. Fishing has been tough lately with last weekâ€™s heavy rain and more in the forecast this weekend. While it is typical summer conditions, the bite has been harder than usual. A few fish are being caught at daylight on Texas and Carolina rigs with big worms in the 15-18 feet along main lake ridges. On mornings with a little wind, a big crankbait like a DD500 can also get some action. A few schooling fish are starting to show up, mostly small to keeper size, and can be caught when they break surface using topwaters or shallow-running shad-colored crankbaits. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

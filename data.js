  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Jun 18, 2025",
    "report": "GOOD. Water stained; 86 degrees; 0.61 feet below pool. Bass fishing is still good. The shallow bite has been productive with topwater lures. A few anglers have also been flipping jigs and beavers into the flooded bushes and hay grass. Most of these shallow fish are coming from 1-4 feet of water. The deeper bite has also been good, out to about 27 feet. Texas rigs and Carolina rigs have been most effective, with a few fish also coming on big crankbaits and football jigs. Crappie fish has been a little off lately due to the big storms over the past week. The rising water and strong winds have made it tough, as crappie do not typically like those conditions. However, things should start to improve in the next couple of days. Brush piles and main lake docks have been the most consistent spots, with both jigs and live bait working. Please watch out for deer as it is the middle of fawn season, and they are actively crossing roads. If you see a deer, please slow down because it is a dangerous time of year for those small fawns. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

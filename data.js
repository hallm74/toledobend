  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Feb 25, 2026",
    "report": "FAIR. 46 degrees; 4.06 feet below pool. Fishing has slowed significantly due to high winds and cold temperatures, with water temperatures dropping back into the mid-50s. A few fish are moving shallow, but presentations must be worked very slowly to get bites. The most consistent action is coming from mid-depth ranges of 8-14 feet using football jigs, Texas-rigged plastics, and crankbaits. Access to main-lake areas has been limited by wind, but conditions are expected to improve and fishing should return to more normal patterns by the weekend. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

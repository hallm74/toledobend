    "report": "SLOW. Water normal stain; 48 degrees; 3.14 feet below pool. Rain is forecasted to end just as the weekend begins. Due to the influx of freshwater the creeks are flowing and the crappie bite is slow. Bass bite has been slow, with a few fish coming on spinnerbaits and chatter baits in 4-7 feet of water, Texas and Carolina rigs on main lake points in 12-18 feet, and big crankbaits in 18-25 feet. The deeper bass are moving with shad from day to day. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

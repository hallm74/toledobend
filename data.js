    "report": "FAIR. 71 degrees; 4.33 feet below pool. Water temperatures have dropped back into the low 60s and upper 50s, and although the lake didn’t receive as much rain as expected, bass fishing remains strong. The shallow bite in 2-5 feet is productive on swim jigs, traps, and wacky worms, while mid-range fish in 8-15 feet are best targeted with Texas rigs and crankbaits. For deeper bass in 22-28 feet, Carolina rigs, drop shots, and spoons are producing the most consistent action. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

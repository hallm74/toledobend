    "report": "SLOW. Water stained; 53 degrees; 2.77 feet below pool. The main lake is stained, but is a good color for fishing and the bite improves daily. Bass are good on spinnerbaits and chatterbaits from 2-4 feet around flooded bushes, lipless baits are good over the top of grass or hay grass in 4-7 feet, Texas and Carolina rigged lizards are good on main lake points from 12-18 feet. No crappie report, but expect this bite to begin any day. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

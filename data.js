    "report": "SLOW. Water stained; 62 degrees; 0.78 feet below pool. More rain in the weekend forecast, be sure to watch weather reports. Bass are good with reported catches up to 9 pounds. While the water remains high the bass are staying shallow in 1-7 feet of water. There is a good bite on wacky worms, swimbaits and chatterbaits. Many fish are still spawning after the full moon and many are post spawn. Crappie are still hit-and-miss with a few showing up on shallow brush piles and some in the creeks. Live bait and road runners are best. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Dec 24, 2025",
    "report": "FAIR. 56 degrees; 4.10 feet below pool. Unseasonably warm conditions at Toledo Bend have pushed water temperatures back into the upper 60s and low 70s, and bass fishing has been very good, with fish being caught from 2-25 feet of water on a wide variety of presentations. Shallow fish are responding well to squarebills, lipless crankbaits, and swim jigs, while deeper bass are being taken on crankbaits, Carolina rigs, and spoons. The main challenge has been heavy fog caused by warm air over cooler water, which has lingered for hours and, at times, all day, so with increased boat traffic on the lake, anglers are urged to use extra caution when running. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

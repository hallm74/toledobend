  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Jan 7, 2026",
    "report": "FAIR. 56 degrees; 4.12 feet below pool. Fishing has been up and down this week, with warm conditions at press time but rain and cooler temperatures expected over the weekend. Largemouth bass have been good on warmer days in 3-8 feet of water using lipless crankbaits, jerkbaits, and chatterbaits, while cooler days require slowing down with wacky worms and light Texas rigs. The deeper bite has been hit or miss, as fish are moving off the bottom to chase shad in 20-28 feet of water, with swimbaits, tail spinners, and spoons producing best. Crappie fishing has been fair, with some good reports coming from the backs of creeks in 4-7 feet of water on Road Runners around flooded timber, though upcoming rain is expected to stain the water and may take a few days to clear. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

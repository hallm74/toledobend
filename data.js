  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Sep 3, 2025",
    "report": "FAIR. 90 degrees; 2.75 feet below pool. Bass fishing has improved with water temperatures now in the mid-80s. The topwater bite is picking up at daylight, lasting about 30-45 minutes unless you catch a cloudy morning, with Pop-Râ€™s Spooks, and buzzbaits working best in 1-5 feet around creek bends, standing timber, and shallow grass. Mid-range action remains steady on Texas rigs and crankbaits in 12-18 feet. With cooler weather in the forecast next week and highs dropping into the low 80s, expect water temperatures to fall and bass activity to ramp up, setting the stage for a strong fall bite. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

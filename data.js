  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Oct 1, 2025",
    "report": "FAIR. 90 degrees; 4.01 feet below pool. Water temperatures remain in the mid-80s, and fishing has been just fair as we wait for that fall cool-down to arrive. Topwater action is decent during the first few hours of daylight in 2-6 feet around grass and timber, but anglers are having to move out to main lake points and ridges in 12-18 feet later in the day with Texas rigs and crankbaits. A few fish are being caught deeper in 20-26 feet on Carolina rigs and spoons, though most have been small. A strong cool front should really help kick things into gear. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

  "fishingReport": {
    "date": "Aug 13, 2025",
    "report": "FAIR. 94 degrees; 2.23 feet below pool. Hot summer conditions have made fishing tough, with the early morning topwater bite showing slight improvement-producing a few fish in the 4 pound range on Yellow Magic, Pop-R, and Spooks-but lasting only 30-45 minutes. With no morning cloud cover, the bite shuts down quickly once the sun clears the trees. Main lake ridge fishing has been fair, improving in the afternoon, with Texas rigs and big crankbaits working best in 15-20 feet of water during the last hour of daylight until dark. Crappie fishing remains very slow, with no solid reports this week. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

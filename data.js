    "date": "Feb 18, 2026",
    "report": "FAIR. 56 degrees; 4.08 feet below pool. Fishing is good overall, with fish being caught from 2-30 feet on a variety of techniques: wacky worms and Senkos are producing shallow, Texas-rigs and Carolina rigs are effective in mid-depths, and tail spinners and drop shots are working well out deep. Crappie action is also good in the backs of creeks; although some areas were muddied by last weekend’s rain, most are clearing quickly, and both live bait and jigs are producing in 4-10 feet. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

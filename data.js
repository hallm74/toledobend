    "report": "FAIR. 90 degrees; 4.24 feet below pool. Water temperatures remain in the mid 80s, but a cool front is expected to move in over the weekend. Fishing has been tough so far, but once that cooler air arrives, the bite should improve quickly. Conditions right now feel more like September fishing than mid-October. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."

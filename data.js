    "report": "FAIR. 56 degrees; 3.96 feet below pool. Spring-like conditions held most of the week, but a weather shift overnight is expected to bring a big change. Water temperatures are currently 59-63 degrees but will likely fall. The shallow bite has been on fire, with fish hitting wacky-rig worms, swimbaits, chatterbaits, and just about anything you like to throw. As temperatures drop, expect the bite to slow, with the best action likely coming in 12 feet of water to the bank; plan to slow down presentations in the mornings and speed them up in the afternoons. The deeper bite faded last week, but cooling conditions should help it rebound, with spoons and dropshots working in 22-28 feet. Report by Stephen Johnston, Johnston Fishing."
